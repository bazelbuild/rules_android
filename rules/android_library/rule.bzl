#### Examples

The following example shows how to use android libraries with resources.

```starlark
android_library(
    name = "hellobazellib",
    srcs = glob(["*.java"]),
    resource_files = glob(["res/**/*"]),
    manifest = "AndroidManifest.xml",
    deps = [
        "//java/bazel/hellobazellib/activities",
        "//java/bazel/hellobazellib/common",
        "//java/bazel/hellobazellib/math",
        "//java/bazel/hellobazellib/service",
    ],
)
```

The following example shows how to set `idl_import_root`. Let `//java/bazel/helloandroid/BUILD` contain:

```starlark
android_library(
    name = "parcelable",
    srcs = ["MyParcelable.java"], # bazel.helloandroid.MyParcelable
    # MyParcelable.aidl will be used as import for other .aidl
    # files that depend on it, but will not be compiled.
    idl_parcelables = ["MyParcelable.aidl"] # bazel.helloandroid.MyParcelable
    # We don't need to specify idl_import_root since the aidl file
    # which declares bazel.helloandroid.MyParcelable
    # is present at java/bazel/helloandroid/MyParcelable.aidl
    # underneath a java root (java/).
)

android_library(
    name = "foreign_parcelable",
    srcs = ["src/android/helloandroid/OtherParcelable.java"], # android.helloandroid.OtherParcelable
    idl_parcelables = [
        "src/android/helloandroid/OtherParcelable.aidl" # android.helloandroid.OtherParcelable
    ],
    # We need to specify idl_import_root because the aidl file which
    # declares android.helloandroid.OtherParcelable is not positioned
    # at android/helloandroid/OtherParcelable.aidl under a normal java root.
    # Setting idl_import_root to "src" in //java/bazel/helloandroid
    # adds java/bazel/helloandroid/src to the list of roots
    # the aidl compiler will search for imported types.
    idl_import_root = "src",
)

# Here, OtherInterface.aidl has an "import android.helloandroid.CallbackInterface;" statement.
android_library(
    name = "foreign_interface",
    idl_srcs = [
        "src/android/helloandroid/OtherInterface.aidl" # android.helloandroid.OtherInterface
        "src/android/helloandroid/CallbackInterface.aidl" # android.helloandroid.CallbackInterface
    ],
    # As above, idl_srcs which are not correctly positioned under a java root
    # must have idl_import_root set. Otherwise, OtherInterface (or any other
    # interface in a library which depends on this one) will not be able
    # to find CallbackInterface when it is imported.
    idl_import_root = "src",
)

# MyParcelable.aidl is imported by MyInterface.aidl, so the generated
# MyInterface.java requires MyParcelable.class at compile time.
# Depending on :parcelable ensures that aidl compilation of MyInterface.aidl
# specifies the correct import roots and can access MyParcelable.aidl, and
# makes MyParcelable.class available to Java compilation of MyInterface.java
# as usual.
android_library(
    name = "idl",
    idl_srcs = ["MyInterface.aidl"],
    deps = [":parcelable"],
)

# Here, ServiceParcelable uses and thus depends on ParcelableService,
# when it's compiled, but ParcelableService also uses ServiceParcelable,
# which creates a circular dependency.
# As a result, these files must be compiled together, in the same android_library.
android_library(
    name = "circular_dependencies",
    srcs = ["ServiceParcelable.java"],
    idl_srcs = ["ParcelableService.aidl"],
    idl_parcelables = ["ServiceParcelable.aidl"],
)
