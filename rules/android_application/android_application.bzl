def android_application(**attrs):
    """Rule to build an Android Application (app bundle).

    `android_application` produces an app bundle (.aab) rather than an apk, and treats splits
    (both configuration and dynamic feature modules) as first-class constructs. If
    `feature_modules`, `bundle_config` or both are supplied this rule will produce an .aab.
    Otherwise it will fall back to `android_binary` and produce an apk.

    **Attributes**

    `android_application` accepts all the same attributes as `android_binary`, with the following
    key differences.

    Name | Description
    --- | ---
    `srcs` | `android_application` does not accept sources.
    `manifest_values` | Required. Must specify `applicationId` in the `manifest_values`
    `feature_modules` | New. List of labels to `android_feature_module`s to include as feature splits. Note: must be fully qualified paths (//some:target), not relative.
    `bundle_config_file` | New. String path to .pb.json file containing the bundle config. See the [bundletool docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/building-cmdline#bundleconfig) for format and examples. Note: this attribute is subject to changes which may require teams to migrate their configurations to a build target.
    `app_integrity_config` | Optional. String path to .binarypb file containing the play integrity config. See https://github.com/google/bundletool/blob/master/src/main/proto/app_integrity_config.proto.
    `rotation_config` | Optional. String path to .textproto file containing the V3 rotation config.
