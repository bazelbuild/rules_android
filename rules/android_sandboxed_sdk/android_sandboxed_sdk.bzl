    """Rule to build an Android Sandboxed SDK.

    A sandboxed SDK is a collection of libraries that can run independently in the Privacy Sandbox
    or in a separate split APK of an app. See:
    https://developer.android.com/design-for-safety/privacy-sandbox.

    Args:
      name: Unique name of this target.
      sdk_modules_config: Module config for this SDK. For full definition see
        https://github.com/google/bundletool/blob/master/src/main/proto/sdk_modules_config.proto
      deps: Set of android libraries that make up this SDK.
      min_sdk_version: Min SDK version for the SDK.
      visibility: A list of targets allowed to depend on this rule.
      testonly: Whether this library is only for testing.
      tags: A list of string tags passed to generated targets.
      custom_package: Java package for which java sources will be generated. By default the package
        is inferred from the directory where the BUILD file containing the rule is. You can specify
        a different package but this is highly discouraged since it can introduce classpath
        conflicts with other libraries that will only be detected at runtime.
